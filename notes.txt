This is a Text File used to store notes about the project and its implementation
This file has no affect on the actual code
=================================================================================

Important
    - No standard filesystem operations [fopen(), fclose(), etc.]
    - We need to make a initialization program callled 'formatfs.c' which initializes the system
        [] will use init_software_disk() at some point
    - We are editing ONLY filesystem.c and formatfs.c
    - Need to use a bitmap for tracking stuff
    - only 1 root directory and no subdirectories
    - Need to use an inode block allocation strategy
        [] will use 13 16-bit DIRECT block numbers and a single INDIRECT block number in each inode
    - should handle out of space errors
    - filenames need to be allowed up to 256 char
        [] need to be null terminated and made of printable ascii
    - DOES NOT need to be thread-safe
    - pay attention to error conditions in FSError
    - MUST also include a design document for the filesystem's physical layout, called 'filesystem_design.pdf'
